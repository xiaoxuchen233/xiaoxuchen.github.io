Hello, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/).I am now working in [Smart Transport Group](https://smart-transport.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). My current research focuses on data-driven modeling and machine learning for urban transportation systems. I received my Master degree in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University, and earned a Bachelor degree in Traffic Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology.

Research interest
======
- Machine learning for transportation modeling
- Spatio-temporal traffic state predication
- Data-driven modeling for urban transportation
- Public transportation operation & planning
